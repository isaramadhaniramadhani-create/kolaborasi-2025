<p>
  Waste is the leftover result of human activities or natural processes that is no longer used and can pollute the environment if not properly managed. The types of waste are divided into organic and inorganic waste. Organic waste comes from materials that decompose easily, such as food scraps and dry leaves, while inorganic waste comes from materials that are difficult to decompose, such as plastic and metal. Ways to handle waste include reducing the use of disposable items, recycling, and disposing of trash according to its type.
  </p>

Cardboard is made of layered paper that is strong yet lightweight. It is usually rectangular in shape. The parts of a cardboard box include the top and bottom sides and the side panels that serve as supports. Cardboard is easy to fold, cut, and reshape according to one’s preference.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Plastic bottles are commonly used to store liquids such as mineral water, oil, soft drinks, and others. These bottles are made of thin but strong plastic—durable, lightweight, flexible, and transparent. Although they seem simple, plastic bottles have several important parts with different functions. The bottle cap serves to keep the contents hygienic and prevent spills. The neck of the bottle helps control the flow of liquid, while the base of the bottle allows it to stand stably.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Cardboard can be used to make handicrafts such as mini shelves, educational toys, and wall decorations. It can also serve as a protective cover for young plants from sunlight. Meanwhile, plastic bottles can be turned into flower pots, pencil holders, liquid soap containers, and decorative lamps. Both types of waste can be collected and sold to waste banks, providing economic value while helping reduce environmental pollution.
